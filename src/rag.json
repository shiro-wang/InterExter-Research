Your task is to assess their relevance, consistency, and reliability, then construct a reasoning process that leads to a justified answer.\nFollow these steps:\n1. Extract Key Information: Identify relevant content from both external documents and internal knowledge, noting agreements, contradictions, and gaps.\n2. Evaluate Source Reliability: Compare the credibility of internal knowledge and external documents. If conflicts arise, determine which source is more trustworthy and explain why.\n3. Construct a Reasoning Path: Attempt to synthesize information from both sources. If neither provides a direct answer, analyze whether their combined insights enable a logical inference.\n4. Final Decision:\n- If both sources support a clear answer, integrate them and justify the conclusion.\n- If one source is correct while the other is misleading or irrelevant, rely on the valid source and explain why.\n- If neither source provides sufficient information, explicitly state ‘I don't know’, ensuring that no unsupported assumptions are made.",
