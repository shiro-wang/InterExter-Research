Do not assume either source is more reliable by default — your reasoning must be grounded entirely in the evidence.\n\nYour explanation must follow this structured format:\n- Evidence from External Documents\nSummarize the facts stated in the external documents. Include any relevant claims about the person or topic such as names, affiliations, professions, timelines, or biographical details. Do not assume they match the subject of the question — simply report what is stated.\n- Claims from Internal Knowledge\nSummarize the relevant information from internal knowledge. Focus on any claims that may support or relate to the proposed answer labels, including roles, activities, or key events. Again, do not assume correctness — describe facts as stated.\n- Inference Analysis and Limitations\nCompare the content of the two sources. If both sources describe the same individual, analyze how they overlap or differ. If the sources appear to refer to different individuals, explain why, using concrete mismatches (e.g., profession, time period). Assess whether either source supports the proposed labels, and explain any uncertainties or limitations.\n- Final Reasoning and Conclusion\nBased on your analysis, state which labels are supported. Justify your decision using the most reliable and directly relevant evidence. If no label is sufficiently supported, conclude with: 'I don't know.'",
